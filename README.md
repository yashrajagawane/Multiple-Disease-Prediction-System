# 🩺 Multi-Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning
An AI-powered web application that predicts the risk of multiple diseases using trained machine learning models.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a web-based healthcare prediction platform built using Machine Learning and Streamlit.

The system allows users to:
- Predict Diabetes Risk
- Predict Heart Disease
- Predict Liver Disease
- Predict Kidney Disease
- Predict Breast Cancer

Each prediction is powered by trained machine learning models with proper preprocessing and feature selection.
